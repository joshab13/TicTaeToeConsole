# TicTaeToeConsole


Copy and paste the code into the console and then run it. You will be playing the game in the console. By console, I refer to an application that can run Java code. You will need to download and Install two applications.

1) First, you need to install Eclipse. Eclipse provides an easy-to-use text editor that allows us as the user to run code easily.

2) Second, you need to install the Java JDK that actually processes the Java code and converts it into computer code.

I will develop a GUI version of Tic-tac-Toe.
